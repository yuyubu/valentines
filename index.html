              I really <b>love</b> this image because of your <i>smile.</i> I
              still remember this day well and how I without thinking locked
              arms with you and played songs after everyone left. It does seem a
              bit inappropriate now but oh well. It is hard to explain this
              feeling but I feel like you have irreversibly changed something
              about me. I never took myself as much of a lover, infact I thought
              I would be quite the dry and cold partner but I guess there was a
              part of me who <b>yearned</b> for someone <i>live you to love.</i>

              I think we have had some of our most important moments on that
              couch. It is partly what started everything to us cuddling on it
              as friends, to you confessing to me there. Sometimes when I lie
              down in silence I happen to look at things in the bigger picture,
              and it always leaves me paralyzed how big of a part you are in me.

              partially what I mean when I talk about how adorable you are.
              Seeing you almost sends this shiver done my whole body telling it
              that something so precious is in front of it now, something if
              lost will never be replaced and only leave a big void behind.
              <br />p.s. I love lifting and spinning you around a lot. I love
              the fact that I am able to lift you. I love holding you close to

              have for me. I feel almost undeserving for all your love and maybe
              I am, but regardless of everything I feel so lucky to even be able
              to have it once. I think of myself as a very lucky man, atleast
              when it comes to love. Who knows how life will play out but you
              give me hope, even if not hope the fact that I was able to
              experience such love fills me up with this feeling I dont know how

              Carrying you on my back. Honestly sometimes I feel like clinging
              onto each others back turning into a big ball of human mush and
              just staying like that till the end of time, not doing anything
              but being wrapped around each other. I sometimes wonder if I take
              our relationship too seriously and in the process of doing so dont
              enjoy it to its fullest in the moment. I am also somewhat stupid
              at times so who knows. I ask myself these question sometimes and
              the answer comes from within me, calling myself stupid and then
              saying just love her and it will be okay.

              The time we started dating again. It was honestly a relief to me
              it was like all the emotions I had bottled up could be let out. I
              was also worried, worried about being left again, worried about my
              social image. My worries never came true and it turned out better
              than I could ever fantasize. Sometimes our relationship seems too
              perfect to me, suspiciously perfect, suspiciously happy. I still
              wonder if there is some great payment I will have to make for this
              happiness, and if there is I cant imagine a price I wont pay.
